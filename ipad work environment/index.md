# iPad based work environment

After a long waiting, I just got my iPad Air on April 2021. The original intent is to replace my kindle (I sold it out) to read books which I felt not comfortable to read on the latter device. Have been struggling between iPad Pro and Air for a while, asked a few owners for their comments, and seems iPad Air is a better choice for both portability and hand holding.

Just after the iPad arrives, in addition to reading books / news, it comes up my mind that I should try to building some infrastructure and coding purely using iPad. 

## Accessories
I bought the Apple Pencil 2 and it is awesome. Jotting notes on the iPad Air, or writing instead of typing into a input text field is very intuitive. It is a must for any serious iPad user.

### Keyboard
The magic keyboard is too expensive. The smart keyboard is too thick. I wanted the iPad to be as slim as possible when carrying around, both are too heavy and thick. They are very well designed, just that I wanted something else. The logitech folio also looks to clumsy to me. at last, I bought a folio and dig out a foldable bluetooth keyboard.

The folio serves as the stand of the ipad while the keyboard can be put on anywhere freely without attaching to the ipad itself.

The beauty of the foldable bluetooth keyboard is that it is 100% same size as the mac keyboard, the down size, is the key response is not as good as the apple one of course, and the keyboard layout is Windows based. It is more portable than the Apple keyboard too.

### Mouse / Trackpad
I've no mouse / trackpad at this moment. Trying to use touch screen instead.

## Apps
It is very likely I've to access the followings in order to fully control any infrastructure.

 - DNS - thru web access manually
 - Cloud Platform - web for initial access, terraform later
 - Git based editor, with editing capability
 - SSH client for accessing terminal
 - A jumphost on infrastucture for extended work like terraform

### SSH - Terminus
Some people recommends blink.sh as it provide an emulated terminal. However I don't see the value of having an emulated terminal in a restricted environment while you are sandboxed from all other apps. 
I myself prefer Terminus, which solely serves as a SSH / Mosh client.

### Git Editor - Working Copy
Not much idea for different tools at this moment. At least the working copy app work as I go. It also helps me to document everything I've done too, including this article I'm typing is using working copy and push to git
